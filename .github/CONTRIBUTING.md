# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome here :heart:

Check our GitHub [issues](https://github.com/eth0net/magicgame/issues) page if you're looking for somewhere to start! :octocat:

There is always room for improvement, why not work to improve documentation and testing if you're stumped? :books:

## Guidelines

Once you've found something you want to work on, make your changes and create a Pull Request! :heavy_check_mark:

### Formatting

Remember to format Go code using gofmt, I recommend setting up VS Code to do it for you. :robot:

### Comments and Documentation

Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) standards and you'll be a star! :star:

All modified code should include proper comments, even if they were missing before. :notebook:

This improves docs for the entire module, making it even easier for new contributors to get started! :seedling:

Breaking changes should be noted in the PR with a reason. Note: These may not be merged for some time. :skull_and_crossbones:

### Testing and Benchmarking

Tests should be included wherever possible, benchmarks are welcome too. :test_tube:

We do welcome PRs without tests, but PRs with tests are preferred. :microscope:

### Commits

Commit messages should convey a clear and concise summary of changes along with a reason for the change. :speech_balloon:

Please try to keep commit messages to 50 characters as this helps when viewing commits in various tools. :eyes:

If you cannot meet these requirements, consider separating your changes into multiple commits. :trident:

Please avoid adding WIP commits to PRs, [squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing) them before opening the PR. :radioactive:

### Questions

Please avoid opening issues to ask questions, instead head over to the new [discussions](https://github.com/eth0net/magicgame/discussions) tab! :memo:
