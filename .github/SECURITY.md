## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities to my email listed on my [profile](https://github.com/eth0net).

I will investigate any reported issues and act accordingly. I will also release a security advisory on the repo if necessary.

If the vulnerability is accepted, I will mark the affected versions and determine the best way to move forward.

- If the issue is within my code, I will work on a fix.
- If the issue is out of my code, I may wait for the module to be updated or consider forking it to fix the issue myself.

You are of course welcome to work on fixes and submit Pull Requests for review.
